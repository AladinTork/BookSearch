# BookSearch 

  ## Description
  
  This project is a book search engine that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books to their account, and view a list of saved books. The application has been built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and has been refactored to use a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their saved books through an intuitive front-end interface.The app's main features include:Book Search: Users can search for books by title, author, or keyword using the Google Books API.User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.Saved Books: Users can save books to their account and view their saved books.GraphQL API: The app replaces the existing RESTful API with a more efficient and flexible GraphQL API using Apollo Server.
